# 🚀 AI-Powered Ticket Creation & Categorization System

Modern IT helpdesks receive a large volume of user-reported issues every day through emails, chat systems, and web forms. These messages are usually unstructured and require manual effort to read, understand, and convert into structured support tickets.

This project automates the **initial ticket creation and categorization process** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning**, reducing manual workload and improving consistency in helpdesk operations.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Support teams manually analyze incoming user messages to create service tickets. This manual approach results in:

- Delays in ticket creation  
- Inconsistent categorization  
- Human errors  
- Increased workload for support staff  

### 🎯 Goal
Automatically analyze user messages and generate **structured IT support tickets** with **minimal human intervention**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
✔ Categorize user issues into predefined ticket categories  
✔ Assign an initial priority based on urgency  
✔ Clean and preprocess unstructured text data  
✔ Extract useful information such as entities and error codes  
✔ Generate a structured ticket from raw user input  
✔ Provide an interactive web interface for real-time ticket creation

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains historical IT support tickets with real-world issue descriptions and corresponding categories.

### Dataset Fields
- **Document** – Raw user issue description  
- **Topic_group** – Assigned issue category  

The dataset is used to train and evaluate the ticket categorization model.
